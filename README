This is a little script I which I was inspired to write by a combination of the
xkcd s/keyboard/leopard/g script and a laptop hacking war I have with a friend.
The script changes all instances of 'good', 'better', 'best', 'optimistic', 
'optimism', and 'optimist' into 'bad', 'worse', 'worst', 'pessimistic', 
'pessimism', and 'pessimist', respectively.

Installation instructions:
	To install this script, simply install the 'Greasemonkey' addon to 
Firefox or Chrome, and simply drag and drop pessimism.user.js onto the browser.
From hereafter, installation is intuitive.

List of Supported Mappings:
good -> bad
better -> worse
best -> worst
optimistic -> pessimistic
optimism -> pessimism
optimist -> pessimist

Further versions will potentially expand to support more obscure words (like
changing 'amazing' to 'awesome'), and allow for reverse mapping (good -> bad
AND bad->good). Other spins may be released allowing for a degree of randomness
(maybe a word gets changed only 10% of the time).
